The Queue ADT
    main operations
    - enqueue
    - dequeue
    - peek
    - size
    - display

Trees
    - leaves
    - branches
    - depth
    - height
    - traversals
        - each of the traversals
        - 3 questions/traversals
    - how many children at most? 
        -> as many as you want

Binary Trees
    - how many children at most? 
        -> 2

    - preorder traversal
    - postorder
    - inorder
        - gives you the values in ascending order
        - vist the node after the left child, before the right child

    - What can happen with binary trees when you insert? 
        -> it can become unbalanced

    Balance
        - left heavy
        - right heavy
        - balanced
            - height difference <= 1
            - What values can we have?
                0
                1
                2
                -1
                -2
                (negative/positve indicates which rotation is needed to balance)

        - Balance Factor = height(left) - height(right)
